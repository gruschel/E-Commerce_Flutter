# E-Commerce App - Flutter UI 

Hi.

I'm Gabriel, a brazilian C++ game developer migrating to mobile development, in Flutter.

This is my first project, which is based on a series on Youtube called "Complete E-Commerce Flutter UI" ("The Flutter Way" YT channel), and the main goals are to analyse what a complete/functional app is made of, study the language syntax and learn how to develop the basic features basically any App has, such as welcoming screen, account creation and login, etc...
